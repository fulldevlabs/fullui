Fulldev UI integrates with all CSS and JS frameworks.

## All JS frameworks

All styles in Fulldev UI use vanilla CSS and classes. Classes use the following naming convention:

- Component classes are the same as the component name, like `button` for `<Button>`.
- Prop classes have the prop name as prefix, like `variant-primary` for `<Button variant="primary">`.
- To prevent conflicts, all styles only apply if there is a `full` class on the element too.

This means you can apply Fulldev UI styles to any framework component as follows:

```astro live
---
import { Button } from 'fulldev-ui'
---

<a class="full button variant-solid contrast"> Button </a>
<Button contrast> Button </Button>
```

## CSS frameworks

All Fulldev UI styles have low specificity, because they are in a native CSS `fulldev` layer. This means you can overwrite them with any CSS framework.

The only thing to be aware of is that styles you want Fulldev UI to overwrite (like a reset), should be in a native CSS `base` layer.

:::note
CSS layers are a baseline CSS feature since 2022. Tailwind V4 will use them by default and others will probably follow. Therefore, over time you would not need to do any setup with Fulldev UI.

## Tailwind

You can place Tailwind's `base` styles in a native CSS `base` layer as follows:

<Steps>

1. Set `applyBaseStyles` to false in the tailwind configuration.

   ```js
   // astro.config.mjs

   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       tailwind({
         applyBaseStyles: false,
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

2. Manually import Tailwind CSS into your project, making sure the `base` layer is in an actual native CSS layer.

   ```css
   @import 'tailwindcss/base' layer(base);
   @import 'tailwindcss/components';
   @import 'tailwindcss/utilities';
   ```

</Steps>

## UnoCSS

UnoCSS does **not** inject base/reset styles by default. Fulldev UI does not rely on style resets, so you you don't need them, you're done here.

If do need a reset, make sure you import it in a native CSS `base` layer. For example:

```css
@import '@unocss/reset/tailwind.css' layer(base);
```

## Other CSS frameworks

Make sure all styles you want Fulldev UI to overwrite are in a native CSS `base` layer. That's it.
