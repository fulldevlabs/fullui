## Props

<PropsTable props={frontmatter.props} />

## Examples

### `size`

<SizeProp />

Heading sizes are handpicked to match the body text size. For each body text size there are
6 matching heading sizes; one for each heading level h1-h6.

The sizes are also responsive, where the larger sizes respond more than the smaller ones.

```astro live
---
import { Heading } from 'fulldev-ui'
---

<Heading size="xs">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="sm">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="md">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</Heading>
<Heading size="lg">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
<Heading size="xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
<Heading size="2xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
<Heading size="3xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
<Heading size="4xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
<Heading size="5xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
```

### `compact`

<CompactProp />

This prop **cannot** be used on the Heading component directly, but the Heading does adapt when used on a parent.

Font-size are reduced relative to their size and also a max-width is set to prevent the text from becoming too wide.

```astro live
---
import { Card, Heading } from 'fulldev-ui'
---

<Card>
  <Heading compact size="xs">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="sm">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="md">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="lg">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="2xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="3xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="4xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading compact size="5xl">The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
</Card>
```

### `contrast`

Set to `true` by default on Headings, which you can override by setting it to `false`.

```astro live
---
import { Group, Heading } from 'fulldev-ui'
---

<Group>
  <Heading>The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
  <Heading contrast={false}>The quick brown fox jumps over the dog</Heading>
</Group>
```
