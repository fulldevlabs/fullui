The compact prop changes the underlying values used by the `size` prop. Just like the `size` prop it cascades, which means it is **inherited from the parent** and it is **applied to all children**.

With the compact prop you are able to use the same component in different contexts, like in a large hero or a small card. It will automatically adapt.
