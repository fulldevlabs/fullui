import DecorativeField from '../../../components/DecorativeField.astro'

Structures children (often Cards) in a masonry.

:::note
Since this component is based on css `columns` rather than grid, it behaves differently. For example, content is distributed in a top-to-bottom, then left-to-right manner.
