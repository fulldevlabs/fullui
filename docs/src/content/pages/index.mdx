import { Box, Button, Group, Heading, Image, Section, Text } from 'fulldev-ui'

<Section structure="split" align="center" size="lg">
  <Box structure="column">
    <Heading size="xl"> A section with equal columns </Heading>
    <Text>
      On mobile it's a single column, of course. All without having to think
      about responsiveness. It just works. Have a look at the code, it's down
      below.
